Polimi 2025/2026 AAPP masters
Primality test on 512bits number
- Implement the Primality test described during the Primality testing lecture (see lecture10PrimalityTest.pdf pp. 12-14).

- The data type used for n can represent a number representable with 512 bits.

- Check the asymptotic complexity with Google Benchmarking library

-Provide sufficient tests to validate the implementation

- Groups up to 3 people
- Changing team for the 2nd challenge is ok
- One week of time
-  points for free in the 1st part of the exam
- Skip selected questions
- Valid any time in the whole academic year
 
Material to be delivered on Webeep:
 - Copy of the Colab with code .pynb (no link)
 - Short PDF report (max 2 pages)
